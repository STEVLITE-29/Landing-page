/* My Design Choices */

So in this Project, i chose to go with a simple design. i wanted to make sure that the navigation throughout the page will be easy and smooth. 
I used a simple layout with a header, a main content area, and a footer. This layout was achieved by using the Bootstrap grid system.

As for color, i chose simple colors that combines deep, moody tones with bright, energizing accents. I went with a sophisticated appeal something that feels premium without being too flashy or overused.
